# FormSubmit Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔧 Updated Configuration

Your form has been updated with the following improvements:

### ✅ What Was Fixed:
1. **Removed redirect URL** - This was causing issues if your domain isn't live yet
2. **Added AJAX submission** - Form now submits via JavaScript for better control
3. **Added proper error handling** - Shows user-friendly error messages
4. **Added confirmation display** - Shows success message in the modal
5. **Added autoresponse** - Users will receive a confirmation email
6. **Reset form state** - Modal properly resets for next use

### 🛠️ Current FormSubmit Settings:
```html
<!-- Email subject line -->
<input type="hidden" name="_subject" value="New Contact Form Submission from Clearvertise">

<!-- Disable captcha for smoother UX -->
<input type="hidden" name="_captcha" value="false">

<!-- Use table format for emails -->
<input type="hidden" name="_template" value="table">

<!-- Send autoresponse to user -->
<input type="hidden" name="_autoresponse" value="Thank you for your interest in Clearvertise! We have received your message and will get back to you within 24 hours.">
```

## 🚨 Email Not Received? Here's How to Fix It:

### Step 1: Verify Your FormSubmit Email
1. Go to: `https://formsubmit.co/el/fuhiha`
2. You should see a page asking you to verify your email
3. Check your email inbox (including spam folder)
4. Click the verification link

### Step 2: Test the Form
1. Fill out your contact form
2. Submit it
3. Check the browser console for any errors (F12 → Console tab)
4. You should see "Form submitted successfully" message

### Step 3: Check for Common Issues

#### A) Email Endpoint Issues:
- Your current endpoint: `https://formsubmit.co/el/fuhiha`
- This might be a hashed/temporary endpoint
- Try using your actual email: `https://formsubmit.co/your-actual-email@domain.com`

#### B) Spam Folder:
- Check your spam/junk folder
- FormSubmit emails sometimes get filtered

#### C) Email Provider Issues:
- Some email providers block automated emails
- Try with a Gmail or Outlook account for testing

## 🔄 Alternative Solution: Use Direct Email Endpoint

If the current endpoint doesn't work, update your form action to use your actual email:

```html
<form id="contactForm" class="contact-form" action="https://formsubmit.co/your-email@domain.com" method="POST">
```

Replace `your-email@domain.com` with your actual email address.

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. Quick Test:
```bash
# Open browser console (F12) and run:
console.log('Testing form submission...');
```

### 2. Manual FormSubmit Test:
1. Create a simple HTML file:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <form action="https://formsubmit.co/your-email@domain.com" method="POST">
        <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name" required>
        <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your Email" required>
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

2. Submit this simple form to test if FormSubmit works with your email

### 3. Debug Network Requests:
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Submit your form
4. Check if the request to FormSubmit succeeds (status 200)

## 🔧 Common FormSubmit Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Email not verified
**Solution:** Visit your FormSubmit endpoint URL directly and verify your email
